			Hi there, I'm Fecc!<br><br>
			I'm a junior front-end developer on the beginning of my carrier. I love web development, because you can create really impressive things from scratch in no time, which reach lots of people worldwide easily. I have a basic understand of backend (some project with Django and Ruby on Rails) but now I concentrate on create awesome pages using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.<br>I'm studying IT in University of Szeged and in a past summer worked for an Web-developer company as a summer intern.That's all for now, hope I can update this site soon!<br>
